atrace: invalid option -- Z

usage: atrace [options] [categories...]
options include:
  -a appname      enable app-level tracing for a comma separated list of cmdlines; * is a wildcard matching any process
  -b N            use a trace buffer size of N KB
  -c              trace into a circular buffer
  -f filename     use the categories written in a file as space-separated
                    values in a line
  -k fname,...    trace the listed kernel functions
  -n              ignore signals
  -s N            sleep for N seconds before tracing [default 0]
  -t N            trace for N seconds [default 5]
  -z              compress the trace dump
  --async_start   start circular trace and return immediately
  --async_dump    dump the current contents of circular trace buffer
  --async_stop    stop tracing and dump the current contents of circular
                    trace buffer
  --stream        stream trace to stdout as it enters the trace buffer
                    Note: this can take significant CPU time, and is best
                    used for measuring things that are not affected by
                    CPU performance, like pagecache usage.
  --list_categories
                  list the available tracing categories
 -o filename      write the trace to the specified file instead
                    of stdout.
